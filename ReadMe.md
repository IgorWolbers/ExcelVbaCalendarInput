# Purpose
The included code files can be used to create a proper date picker in an Excel using VBA for a user input control. This is currently not possible in the latest verion of Excel out of the box. 

# Solution Source
This code was exported from an Excel solution posted by [Siddharth Rout][2] in StackOverflow in response to the question [StackOverflow - How can I create a calendar input in VBA Excel?][1]. _I am not the original author_.

# Why this Repo?
I feel there is value in having the code files be made available in GitHub so that they can be forked and also Pull Requested if there is a fix that needs to be made public and distributed back to the community.

# Original File
I included the original file `Original File - New Calendar Ver 5.xlsm`.

# Claims
I make no warranties, guarantees, or other claims about the included files. Use at your own discretion and risk.
